    Ramsey Harrison     TA          explained how to make a sample in rsa.py
                                    explained how to do the keygen function in rsa.py

    Moiz Amjad          SI           He solved some little code issues like I wrote stdio.writeln
                                     instead of stdio.write in encrypt.py

4. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (RSA Library)
      Approach: I solved _sample and _choice first so that I can use them
      in the keygen function. Using that and some help from TA and SI I solved the keygen function

      Issues and resolution: I faced issues with Keygen function and did not use the choice
      and sample in keygen. So the code was repetitive and long.The SI helped me to see this issue and I solved
      the way around

   Problem 2 (Keygen Program)
      Approach: After I was done with the rsa library keygen was straight-forward got to values from
      command line argument  which are lo and hi. Using that wrote in standard form the three values in
       the tuple

      Issues and resolution: I faced no issues with this problem

   Problem 3 (Encryption Program)
      Approach: Used functions from the rsa library to solve this problem

      Issues and resolution: I wrote stdio.writeln instead of stdio.write and it
      was not giving the right output. So the TA helped me identify the issue.

   Problem 4 (Decryption Program)
      Approach: Used the functions from the rsa library to solve this problem.

      Issues and resolution: I did mistakes with the range of 'i' and it made it output
      wrong string values.

5. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   I believe this project was easier than project 3 and was more related to Mathematics.
   The TA and SI helped me with troubleshooting some silly issues.
   I learnt new functions like ord() and chr(). Overall this was more fun to do among all
   the projects I did before because I was actually curious how the RSA system works.
